# MiSTer Turbo Cores

A list of known MiSTer turbo cores and where to acquire them

## Why?

A number of the MiSTer cores have a "turbo" core available which provides an overclocked version of the official core.
These cores are no longer cycle accurate and may cause issues in certain games, but they also provide an FPS boost in otherwise poor performing tiles.
